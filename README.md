# marching_faces

Marching Faces is a Processing sketch that uses the black and white values of an image to produce marching squares (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares)
I made this using some code from Daniel Shiffman's tutorial on marching squares (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZONMNUKTfU)
If you go here https://webcamtests.com/ you can get the specifics of your webcam and input them in the code. The parameters that you need are the width and height of the 
camera's output and the framerate, which you put in the  cap = new Capture(this, 1280, 720, 30);

Oh and you also need Processing https://processing.org/
